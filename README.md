# Points-Classification-With-Neural-Network--java-eclipse--
In this project there are 2 folders with java-ecliplse files.
The Dataset Creator folder contains the files necessary to create and visualize a dataset of two-dimensional points(x,y).
After creating the points , the points are written to a txt file(dataset.txt) and at the end of each line their category(1,2,3,4) is marked. 

The Neural Network folder contains the files responsible for creating and running a 2 hidden layer neural network,
which makes predictions about the category of points.
The neural network performs the forward pass and back propagation operations.
The path of the dataset is specified at the beginning of the Network.java file. 
The activation functions of the neurons of the two hidden layers and the output are specified.
Also then the number of epochs for training, the number of points(for training), the size of the input(2) and output(4) of the network,
and finally the number of neurons in each of the hidden layers is selected.
